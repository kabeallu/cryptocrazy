### Ingredients
- 1 3/4 cups Flour
- 1/2 cup cocoa powder
- 2 tsp Baking Powder
- 1 cup White Sugar
- 125g Butter
- 2 Tbsp Golden Syrup
- 2 eggs
- 1 1/2 cups Milk
- 2 tsp Baking Soda
- 1 tsp vanilla essence

### Icing:
- 1 1/2 cups Icing Sugar
- 1 Tbsp cocoa powder
- 50g Butter, softened
- 2 Tbsp Water


### Method
1. Preheat oven to 180Â°C bake. Grease prefered cake tin.

2. Mix together the Flour, cocoa, Baking Powder and White Sugar.

3. In separate bowl, melt the Butter and Golden Syrup together (about 1 minute on high in the microwave usually does it).

4. In another bowl whisk the eggs, then whisk in the  Milk, Baking Soda and vanilla. Add both the butter mix and the egg/milk mix to dry ingredients and beat on medium for 1 minute.

5. Spoon into prepared tin and level the surface. Bake for 50-60 minutes, until the top of the cake bounces back when lightly pressed and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool in tin for 10-15 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

### Icing:
1. Place all icing ingredients in a medium bowl. Beat on low to combine, then increase speed to high and beat until smooth and creamy. Spread onto cooled cake.
