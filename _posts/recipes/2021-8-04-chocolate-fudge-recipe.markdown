### INGREDIENTS
- 2 cups sugar
- 2 Tbsp cocoa
- 25g butter
- ½ cup milk
- ½ tsp vanilla essence

### METHOD
1. Lightly grease a 20cm square tin.

2. Mix the sugar and cocoa in a saucepan and add the butter and milk.

3. Heat gently, stirring constantly until the butter has melted and the sugar dissolved, about 10 minutes.

4. Stop stirring, bring to the boil and simmer until the mixture reaches the soft ball stage (114˚C on a sugar thermometer).

5. Immediately remove the pan from the heat, add the vanilla and let stand for 5 minutes.

6. Beat with a wooden spoon until the fudge begins to thicken, then quickly pour into the tin and mark into squares. Cut when cold.
